        <ContentText>&lt;p&gt;For proof that Leonardo DiCaprio can't save every film he touches, look no further than
            “And We Go Green,” a languid documentary about the electric car racing circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DiCaprio, who is a producer of the film, makes a cameo in the 26th minute, adding a dash of
            Hollywood glamour but not really helping clean up this messy project. For a film about super-fast cars
            making hairpin turns at hundreds of miles per hour, it really meanders.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The documentary’s spine is the fourth Formula E championship of 2017-18, which had 12 races in 10
            cities, pitting 20 drivers from 10 teams. It begins with a false start in Hong Kong and ends with the
            crowning of a winner in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Along the way, we have quite revealing snapshots of the drivers. Some are arrogant, others more
            humble. One is mourning a friend's death on the track, another feels overshadowed by his more successful
            racing father. They're all struggling with the demands of electric race cars. “It’s like playing chess at
            200 kph.” one driver says.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Many of the drivers — including Britain's Sam Bird, France's Jean-Eric Vergne and Brazil's Nelson
            Piquet Jr. — are seeking redemption after falling out of &lt;replaced
            captured="favor"&gt;favour&lt;/replaced&gt; or never getting to race at the gas-powered bigger brother
            Formula One.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Co-directors Fisher Stevens and Malcolm Venville fill the film with many of these snapshots but
            they don't connect them into a single coherent arc or pare them down to a single rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The film — which streams Thursday on Hulu — then makes maddening detours into the nuts and bolts of
            making electric racing cars, a look at Formula One gods like Ayrton Senna and an overly gauzy portrait of
            Alejandro Agag, the head of Formula E, who says things like: “The revolution is coming. It’s just a matter
            of time."&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Agag, a charismatic Formula One veteran and a former Spanish politician, is a cigar-smoking race
            fan who admits creating a green Formula One was more a business decision than the product of an
            environmental activist, which is a little deflating.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Enter uber-cool green guy DiCaprio, in sunglasses he never removes. He asks questions about how
            batteries stay cool and gets a lesson on environmental race fuel Aquafuel — even tasting it. DiCaprio seems
            to try to pull the film into the science side. “It’s almost like a tech race now,” he concludes. Then he
            vanishes.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the documentary cameras beautifully capture the sleek Formula E cars as they rev and whine,
            there are also a lot of distractions, like slow-motion dancers welcoming fans on the Mexico City
            track.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At times, it seems like “And We Go Green” is really a long commercial for Formula E, with a little
            soap opera among the drivers thrown in and a peek into the tech of the cars. But none of it really stays on
            the road. It's not a compelling environmental film or a good drama about racers. Like many of the electric
            cars on the track that season, it stalls.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;“And We Go Green,” a RadicalMedia release, is not rated but has strong language and footage of
            deadly car crashes. Running time: 98 minutes. One star out of four.&lt;/p&gt;
