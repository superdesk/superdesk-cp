<div class="mw_release"><p align="justify">TORONTO, June  09, 2020  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- <strong>Auxly Cannabis Group Inc. (TSX.V: XLY) (OTCQX: CBWTF) </strong>(“<strong>Auxly</strong>” or the “<strong>Company</strong>”) has issued an additional $3 million worth of unsecured convertible debentures (collectively, the “<strong>Third Tranche</strong>”) under its $25 million unsecured convertible debenture standby facility with an institutional investor (the “<strong>Investor</strong>”) as previously announced on April 28, 2020 (the “<strong>Original Offering</strong>”).<br /></p>      <p align="justify">Under the Third Tranche, the convertible debentures issued to the Investor have a conversion price of $0.38 per common share of the Company (each a “<strong>Common Share</strong>”), and the Investor received warrants to purchase 4,342,105 Common Shares until June 8, 2022 at an exercise price of $0.46 per Common Share. Each convertible debenture will mature on June 8, 2022 and will bear guaranteed interest from the date of issue at 7.5% per annum, payable semi-annually on June 30 and December 31 of each year and has the same terms and conditions as described in the Original Offering and the transaction documents filed on the Company’s SEDAR profile.</p>      <p align="justify">In connection with the completion of the Third Tranche, the Company has agreed to indemnify (the “<strong>Indemnity</strong>”) certain of its directors and officers for any and all losses not otherwise recoverable from the collateral provided by the Investor for the Common Shares provided by such directors and officers to the Investor pursuant to the terms of the investment agreement. The Indemnity may constitute a related party transaction under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – <em>Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions</em> ("<strong>MI 61-101</strong>") but is otherwise exempt from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements of MI 61-101. The Indemnity has been approved by the independent directors of the Company. No special committee was established in connection with the Original Offering, the completion of the Third Tranche or the granting of the Indemnity, and no materially contrary view or abstention was expressed or made by any director of the Company in relation thereto. Further details will be included in a material change report that will be filed by the Company in connection with the completion of the Third Tranche. The Company did not file the material change report more than 21 days before the expected closing date of the Third Tranche as the details of the Third Tranche and the terms of the Indemnity were not settled until shortly prior to the closing of the Third Tranche, and the Company wished to complete the Third Tranche on an expedited basis for sound business reasons. </p>      <p align="justify">All securities issued by the Company under the Third Tranche are subject to a statutory four-month hold period in accordance with applicable securities legislation and final approval of the TSX Venture Exchange. </p>      <p align="justify">AltaCorp Capital Inc. is acting as exclusive agent on the Third Tranche.</p>      <p align="justify">This news release does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any of the securities referenced herein in the United States.
